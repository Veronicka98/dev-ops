Many everyday tasks provide opportunities to build skills in decomposition. It might surprise you to discover that your mind just works this way!
For example, if I have to clean up a really messy kitchen (perhaps some little girls just baked a cake), I break the tasks down to provide a plan, and to make sure I don't have to re-do work later. I don't want to wash the floor first if there's all kinds of stuff on the counters to clean up - I'll probably have to do the floor again later. So, maybe I put all the ingredients away first; move all the dishes into the sink; clean off the counters; wash the dishes; and finally, clean up the floor. There are other ways to perform this task, but by thinking it through first, it helps me define a plan that will not require re-work.

Use everyday tasks as examples for developing your decomposition skills. Who knows - it might even make you more efficient around the house!
One of the best ways to learn how to program in a new language is by looking at lots and lots of example programs. The best thing to do is to copy and paste each program below into a text file and compile it. Then, try the experiments. By extending these example programs, you will gain familiarity with different aspects fo C++, and you will feel more confident when it comes time to write programs from scratch. hello scratch. hello scratch. hello scratch. hello scratch. hello scratch. hello
